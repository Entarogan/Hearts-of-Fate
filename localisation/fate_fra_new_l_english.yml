 alice_event.10.d:0 "It was another normal working day, at least according to the Thuleschutztruppes who guarded the house of Einzbern. But the quiet day was broken by an explosion in the yard. At the moment of the explosion, several dolls usually used for viewing suddenly got up and hugged the soldiers standing guard outside the hall. Today, Alice, who is usually quiet and withdrawn, jumped from the second floor to the courtyard car like a trained agent and flipped out of the blown crack in the wall. And Irisviel on the tower just watched it happen in silence. In the end, Alice "borrowed" a pickup truck and fled all the way to Switzerland, while border guards in Bavaria were messed up by frequent explosions of Goliath remote-controlled tanks. Darnic, who received the news, immediately sent someone to occupy the Margatroid's house, only to find that it had already been emptied. "

 alice_event.11.d:0 "After persuading Alice Margatroid to go to the dinner party at Einzbern's house in Germany in the name of "exchanging technology", Darnic discovered that the matter was out of his control. The German side seems to have unimaginable enthusiasm for Miss Margroyd’s skills. As Darnic was preparing to return, Himmler informed Darnic that they had “persuaded” Miss Margatroid to stay and participate in “important research” ". Although Darnic was very unwilling, he still relied on relations with Germany until now, and he could only choose to default this result."

 alice_event.12.d:0 "After persuading Alice Margatroid to go to the dinner party at Einzberen’s home in Germany in the name of "exchanging technology", Darnic found that things were not what he wanted. Alice humiliated Himmler and Heidrich at the banquet, two important members of the German Thuleschutztruppes, which made Darnic very faceless. However, Alice's tough attitude allowed Darnic to continue to enjoy the help of Alice's own technology, and because of this, even though it was very unpleasant, Darnic did not get angry with Alice Margatroid."

On any harbinger night, Alice Margatroid detonated the Yggdmillennia laboratory she managed and fled the control area. Although the guard soldiers tried to intercept, Alice's pre-set remote control weapon successfully hindered the hunt. One day later, she jumped on the last ship that left Romania and fled the country."
